# JAVA_API_Project

## Project Aims
This project was created with the intention of testing all major end points of the Police API and to extract this information
into a readable format. 

## How to use
In order to use/test this project you will need to specify your requested actions via the main method (currently empty). The project works 
by using the PoliceJSONParser as the object that creates a call to the Police API and then stores the data retrieved. From this original
data you can navigate the other endpoints to achieve information based on specific areas, specific case ID's and more (read Police API docs#
